# Concept of SciWIn as part of the reproducible science toolset in FAIRagro

## Thematic note

This text is deliverable D4.4.1 of Measure 4.4. in Task Area 4 of the NFDI consortium FAIRagro.
"SciWIn" stands for **Sci**entific **W**orkflow **In**frastructure and denotes the overall of Masure 4.4.
The original title set forth in the proposal [@ewert2023] was
"Joint concept of SciWIn as part of the RDC semantic toolset".
Several assumptions made at the time of writing the proposal did not materialize.
It was therefore necessary to adapt the direction of the project
and consequently the thrust of its conceptualization.

### Embedding of SciWIn in the wider NFDI context

The proposal foresaw the integration of SciWIn into a joint infrastructure involving in particular an "RDC mediation
layer" [@ewert2023],
where "RDC" stands for "Research Data Commons",
which was anticipated to become "an overarching virtual expandable infrastructure" [@glockner2020] hosting "cross-cutting services" [@bierwirth2020].
While @glockner2020 and @bierwirth2020 are mere declarations of intent,
the consortium NFDI4BioDiversity proposed to establish RDC as a cloud-based research infrastructure
and provided a high-level architectural layered concept for RDC [@glockner2020a]
into which SciWIn was supposed to be integrated.

In June 2024 we organized a meeting with stakeholders from NFDI4Biodiversity, which were involved in the design and
implementation of the NFDI4BioDiversity-specific RDC (Bio-RDC).
It turned out that at that point in time, no practically usable infrastructure in the original sense of RDC existed, therefore preventing SciWIn from pursuing an integration into an RDC.
Bio-RDC was rather meant as a "blue print"

[diepenbroek2023]
The concept of data integration is partly described in the RDC mediation layer and covered by semantic tools (Glöckner
et al., 2020), and a concept for integrated data and process storage is part of the DataPLANTs ARC model (Krantz et al.,
2021)

Develop the concept of SciWIn (Measure 4.4) jointly together under the umbrella of the
NFDI-RDC and collaborate with NFDI4BioDiversity and DataPLANT as well as the
prototypic container deployment to the de.NBI cloud node at BLU;


A SciWIn pilot will be rolled out at de.NBI operated by Bielefeld University (BLU).

The concept of data integration is
partly described in the RDC mediation layer and covered by semantic tools (Glöckner et al.,
2020), and a concept for integrated data and process storage is part of the DataPLANTs ARC
model (Krantz et al., 2021), but a fully integrated infrastructure is provided by neither of those
consortia. Therefore, Measure 4.4 will extend the two architectural designs and provide a
workflow infrastructure that applies the FAIR DO concepts (Measure 3.5), the service
middleware components (Measure 4.2) and its own workflow hub as an easy-to-use interface
to work on and create new FAIR DO outputs with automatically annotated provenance graphs.

SciWIn will be part of the NFDI cross-cutting topic “RDC implementations”, and therefore, its
concept will be developed as a joint effort between FAIRagro, FAIR-DS, Dataplant and the NFDI
section, RDC [as part of cross-cutting topics (Ebert et al., 2021)]. Coordinated in Measure 5.3,
the SciWIn working group brings these stakeholders together and will be initiated by a kickoff
meeting (M4.4.1). Thus, the fundamental principles, architectures and interfaces are described,
and a coordinated concept will be created and published (D4.4.1), which will incorporate the
RDC ideas and DataPLANTs ARC model.
