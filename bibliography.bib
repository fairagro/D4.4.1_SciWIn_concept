  abstract = {Biodiversity is more than just the diversity of living species. It includes genetic and phenotypic diversity of organisms, functional diversity, interactions and the diversity of populations and whole ecosystems. The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report confirmed that our planet experiences a rapid loss of biodiversity with dramatic consequences for mankind. Answers to scientifically and societal relevant questions can only be found based on the availability of data integrated from multiple sources and building on different knowledge domains in science and society. The FAIR data principles provide a framework towards such integration. To foster access to interoperable data, NFDI4BioDiversity focuses on the following six objectives: 1) Promoting research data management as an integral part of biodiversity research, 2) Enabling FAIRness of data, 3) Consolidating FAIRness with quality, 4) Embedding NFDI4BioDiversity into the (inter-)national landscape, 5) Addressing NFDI-wide cross-cutting topics and 6) Promoting collaborative governance, viability and sustainability of data infrastructure services and science. These objectives are implemented by the NFDI4BioDiversity work programme and its five task areas: {$<$}strong{$>$}Task Area 1 - Community engagement (2involve):{$<$}/strong{$>$} This task area will integrate across different knowledge holders and take care of research data management requests related to biodiversity data. A large part of all species data is collected by volunteers in natural history societies, NGOs, museums and citizen science projects as well as collected by different authorities This task area includes 23 use cases with community-driven topics and cross-domain user groups. {$<$}strong{$>$}Task Area 2 - National and international networking (2connect):{$<$}/strong{$>$} This task area ensures that any cross-domain activities and developments of NFDI4BioDiversity are coordinated and in-line with the overall development of the NFDI as well as international activities. {$<$}strong{$>$}Task Area 3 - Long-term data, tools and service preservation, certification (2consolidate):{$<$}/strong{$>$} This task area consolidates existing German infrastructures and data pipelines for long-term FAIR data preservation, archiving and publication and guides them towards certification. {$<$}strong{$>$}Task Area 4 - Data integration, exploration, and exploitation - the NFDI-Research Data Commons (NFDI-RDC, {$<$}/strong{$><$}strong{$>$}4all \&amp; 4future): {$<$}/strong{$>$}This task area develops a Cloud-based research infrastructure that provides scientists, providers and users with the technical baseline for exchanging data and services in a collaborative research environment.

The analysis is described by means of a YAML file that captures sufficient information about the analysis assets, parameters and processes. The REANA platform consists of a set of micro-services allowing to launch and monitor container-based computational workflow jobs on the cloud. The REANA user interface and the command-line client enables researchers to easily rerun analysis workflows with new input parameters. The REANA platform aims at supporting several container technologies (Docker), workflow engines (CWL, Yadage), shared storage systems (Ceph, EOS) and compute cloud infrastructures (Ku-bernetes/OpenStack, HTCondor) used by the community.REANA was developed with the particle physics use case in mind and profits from synergies with general reusable research data analysis patterns in other scientific disciplines, such as bioinformatics and life sciences.},

As a way to overcome these challenges, we further develop the proposals by early Internet pioneers for Digital Objects as encapsulations of data and metadata made accessible by persistent identifiers. In the past decade, this concept was revisited by various groups within the Research Data Alliance and put in the context of the FAIR Guiding Principles for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. The basic components of a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) as a self-contained, typed, machine-actionable data package are explained. A survey of use cases has indicated the growing interest of research communities in FDO solutions. We conclude that the FDO concept has the potential to act as the interoperable federative core of a hyperinfrastructure initiative such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).},

  abstract = {Recording the provenance of scientific computation results is key to the support of traceability, reproducibility and quality assessment of data products. Several data models have been explored to address this need, providing representations of workflow plans and their executions as well as means of packaging the resulting information for archiving and sharing. However, existing approaches tend to lack interoperable adoption across workflow management systems. In this work we present Workflow Run RO-Crate, an extension of RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) and Schema.org to capture the provenance of the execution of computational workflows at different levels of granularity and bundle together all their associated objects (inputs, outputs, code, etc.). The model is supported by a diverse, open community that runs regular meetings, discussing development, maintenance and adoption aspects. Workflow Run RO-Crate is already implemented by several workflow management systems, allowing interoperable comparisons between workflow runs from heterogeneous systems. We describe the model, its alignment to standards such as W3C PROV, and its implementation in six workflow systems. Finally, we illustrate the application of Workflow Run RO-Crate in two use cases of machine learning in the digital image analysis domain.},

This new edition incorporates agile development without abandoning traditional linear approaches. The authors show how all projects--agile and serial--need requirements in one form or another. They show how serial projects can adopt some agile techniques without losing the advantage of a complete specification, and how agile projects can benefit from an emphasis on prototyping and modeling to give a better understanding of the problem and of the product's needs.

  abstract = {In modern reproducible, hypothesis-driven plant research, scientists are increasingly relying on research data management (RDM) services and infrastructures to streamline the processes of collecting, processing, sharing, and archiving research data. FAIR (i.e., findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) research data play a pivotal role in enabling the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge and facilitating the comparison and synthesis of a wide range of analytical findings. The PLANTdataHUB offers a solution that realizes RDM of scientific (meta)data as evolving collections of files in a directory – yielding FAIR digital objects called ARCs – with tools that enable scientists to plan, communicate, collaborate, publish, and reuse data on the same platform while gaining continuous quality control insights. The centralized platform is scalable from personal use to global communities and provides advanced federation capabilities for institutions that prefer to host their own satellite instances. This approach borrows many concepts from software development and adapts them to fit the challenges of the field of modern plant science undergoing digital transformation. The PLANTdataHUB supports researchers in each stage of a scientific project with adaptable continuous quality control insights, from the early planning phase to data publication. The central live instance of PLANTdataHUB is accessible at (https://git.nfdi4plants.org), and it will continue to evolve as a community-driven and dynamic resource that serves the needs of contemporary plant science.},
