of SciWIn as part of the reproducible science toolset in FAIRagro</h1>
<h2 id="thematic-note">Thematic note</h2>
<p>This text is deliverable D4.4.1 of Measure 4.4. in Task Area 4 of the
NFDI consortium FAIRagro. “SciWIn” stands for
<strong>Sci</strong>entific <strong>W</strong>orkflow
<strong>In</strong>frastructure and denotes the overall delivrable of
Measure 4.4. This document concludes Action 1 of Measure 4.4. The title
set forth in the proposal <span class="citation"
data-cites="ewert2023">[@ewert2023]</span> was “Joint concept of SciWIn
as part of the RDC semantic toolset” Several assumptions made at the
time of writing the proposal did not materialize. It was therefore
necessary to adapt the direction of the project and consequently the
thrust of its conceptualization.</p>
<h3 id="the-missing-research-data-commons">The missing Research Data
Commons</h3>
<p>The proposal foresaw the integration of SciWIn into a joint
infrastructure involving in particular an “RDC mediation layer” <span
class="citation" data-cites="ewert2023">[@ewert2023]</span>, where “RDC”
stands for “Research Data Commons”. RDC was anticipated to become “an
overarching virtual expandable infrastructure” <span class="citation"
data-cites="glockner2020">[@glockner2020]</span> hosting “cross-cutting
services for the NFDI” <span class="citation"
data-cites="bierwirth2020">[@bierwirth2020]</span>. While <span
class="citation" data-cites="glockner2020">@glockner2020</span> and
<span class="citation" data-cites="bierwirth2020">@bierwirth2020</span>
are mere declarations of intent, the consortium NFDI4BioDiversity
proposed to establish RDC as a cloud-based research infrastructure and
provided a high-level architectural layered concept for RDC <span
class="citation" data-cites="glockner2020a">[@glockner2020a]</span> into
which SciWIn was supposed to be integrated.</p>
<p>In addition to “RDC” as infrastructure, the term “RDC” was also used
in the FAIRagro proposal in the sense of a set of criteria that services
should fulfil be be interoperable with the NFDI-wide infrastructure. It
was proposed that “FAIRagro will comply with the NFDI-RDC” and that
“Storage Instances [of M4.4] … will hold RDC-compliant FAIR DOs …”</p>
<p>In June 2024 we organized a meeting with stakeholders from
NFDI4Biodiversity, which were involved in the design and implementation
of the NFDI4BioDiversity-specific RDC (Bio-RDC). It turned out that at
that point in time, RDC existed as “a blueprint”, an “architectural
model” and a collection of specfic individual services, namely</p>
<ul>
<li>An image annotation software, <a
href="https://biigle.de/">BIIGLE</a></li>
<li>The terminology-related <a
href="biodivportal.gfbio.org">BiodivPortal</a> (not reachable at the
time of writing)</li>
<li>A search engine for biological data <a
href="https://search.gfbio.org/">GFBio Search</a></li>
<li>An object storage technology, <a
href="https://aruna-storage.org/">Aruna</a></li>
<li>An AAI-provider, <a href="https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/">Life
Science Login</a> by EOSC-Life</li>
<li>A KPI monitoring service, <a
href="https://scorpion.bi.denbi.de/">Scorpion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The conceptual ideas had no actionable specification or reference
implementation and also seemed to be still in flux. A move to a more
domain-oriented decentralized architectural paradigm (<a
href="https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/">“data mesh concept”</a>)
was considered. The six approved RDC services on the other hand did not
bear direct touching points with SciWIn or FAIRagro. A list of criteria
that services should fulfil in order to be “RDC compliant” was planned
by TA4 of NFDI4Biodiversity but not yet published.</p>
<h3 id="changed-directions">Changed Directions</h3>
<p>Under these circumstances we had to deal with the fact that there did
not exist an “RDC” or an “RDC semantic toolset” into which SciWIn could
have been meaningfully integrated. Also the realization of such a thing
did not seem likely in a timeframe that would allow to take it into
account in the planning and design of SciWIn. Another consequence of the
lack of RDC or a clear path towards its realization was the lack of
FAIRagro external cooperation partners to develop a “joint concept” with
respect to “the RDC semantic toolset”.</p>
<p>In order to stay true to the spirit of this action as originally
considered, we developed a set of goals to capture the essence of Action
1. Drawing from <span class="citation"
data-cites="bierwirth2020">@bierwirth2020</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="glockner2020">@glockner2020</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="diepenbroek2023">@diepenbroek2023</span>,
we defined characteristics that would 1) increase the chance for SciWIn
to become a part of an NFDI-RDC if that concept were actually
implemented, and 2) maximize cross-domain usage, usefulness and
synergies in any case:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While primarily use-cases and requirement from the agrosystem
science community drive SciWIn’s developent in FAIRagro, it should
nevertheless be domain-agnostic and potentially unleash its full
potential also in other quantitative research domains.</li>
<li>SciWIn tools and services should be easily accessible for
researchers from other NFDI concortial and other domains in
general.</li>
<li>SciWIn should be based on data formats and protocols that are well
established, domain-agnostic and future-proof to maximize the chances
for wide adoption and interoperability.</li>
<li>SciWIn should actively exploit existing servcies and services that
are currently<br />
being developed
<ul>
<li>to avoid re-invention of the wheel,</li>
<li>to increase development efficiency and</li>
<li>to be exposed early on to the greater research ecosystem</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sciwin-components">SciWIn components</h2>
<p>The original idea of the SciWIn design, as laid out in an ecosystem
map (<span class="citation" data-cites="ewert2023">@ewert2023</span>,
Figure 16) features five components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An AAI provider,</li>
<li>The “Workflow Hub”,</li>
<li>Compute instances,</li>
<li>Storage instances, and</li>
<li>Workflow Objects</li>
</ol>
<p>In that conceptualization, only the “Workflow Hub” was supposed to be
developed an a dedicated infrastructure item by SciWIn, while the other
components are existing services that communicate with the “Workflow
Hub”. The main purpose of the “Workflow Hub” was the creation of
“Workflow Objects”.</p>
<p>The actual desing differs from this early sketch. Realizing that the
main challenge to be solved lies in the provisioning of tooling for the
easy creation of workflows, this task is now assigned to a stand-alone
program that scientists use at their workstations in their daily
workflow without requiring internet-access, a central service, or
authorization. This stand-along program is called
<strong>SciWIn-Client</strong>. The second important function of
SciWIn-Client is the communication with compute instances to enable
scientists to submit computational workflows for remote execution and
fetch the results. SciWIn-Client thus implements the functionality that
was assigned to “Workflow Hub” in the initial sketch in the
proposal.</p>
<p>In addition to SciWIn-Client we are planning to realize a second
software-project within Measure 4.4, the <strong>SciWIn-Hub</strong>.
The need for SciWIn-Hub stems from the realization that the data
repositories (“Storage Instances” such as <em>e!DAL-PGP</em>,
<em>Bonares</em>, <em>TISDAR</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in the proposal) are not
suited to FAIRly handle computational workflows to realize the full
potential of re-usable, re-combineable, modular computational workflows.
The existing repositories are still useful in this context to publish
workflows as citeable scientific output that is reliably preserved over
long time-spans. However, a programatically driven, non interactive
submission of content is not possible with such repositories, and
sometimes even reading data requires interactive operation.</p>
<p><strong>Access</strong> to SciWIn-Hub and other services, such as the
__FAIRagro Searchable Inventory of Services and Data_ (<span
class="citation" data-cites="ewert2023">@ewert2023</span>, pp. 94-96)
and compute instances, will be managed by the NFDI-wide Base4NFDI
project <em>IAM4NFDI</em>, that is supported by the Working Group
Identity and Access Management (<span class="citation"
data-cites="pempe2022">@pempe2022</span>). Integration of this AAI
solution into FAIRagro is performed by FAIRagro Measure 4.2.
<strong>SciWIn-Client</strong> will implement the respective
authorization protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Workflow objects</strong> in the SciWIn-context are data
structures that encapsulate the definition of workflows with associated
code and data or references to code and data. Since a close
collaboration between FAIRagro and NFDI Consortium DataPLANT is
established on different levels, we have taken into account their
version of a FAIR Digital Object, the Annotated Research Context (ARC),
and the established standards on which it is based. These are the Common
Workflow Language (CWL, <span class="citation"
data-cites="crusoe2022">@crusoe2022</span>) to specify computational
workflows and the Research Object Crate (RO-Crate, <span
class="citation"
data-cites="soiland-reyes2022">@soiland-reyes2022</span>) as a data
structure to package data (which here also includes code and workflow
descriptions). While compatibility with the advanced tooling and
infrastructure of DataPLANT is an important piece to achieve synergies
with this consortium covering a neighboring research domain, CWL and
RO-Crate represent the state-of-the art for workflow descriptions and
semantically annotated metadata formats. Therefore, they are also used
or considered by other NFDI consortial, e.g. NFDI4Ing (<span
class="citation" data-cites="bronger2022">@bronger2022</span>) and
NFDI4Health (<span class="citation"
data-cites="lobe2024">@lobe2024</span>). Furthermore, the semanitic
annotation of metadata allows for the integration of such FAIR Digital
Objects into knowledge graphs that interconnect different domains.</p>
<p>The choice of CWL as workflow description language ensures that
workflows created by SciWIn can be executed on a broad range of
platforms (<span class="citation"
data-cites="cwlimplementations2025">@cwlimplementations2025</span>).
However, many of these platforms require significant ressources for
setup and operation. Different platforms have different sets of compute
backends, such as HTCondor, AWS, Azure, SLURM and Kubernetes.
Additionally, the interaction with remote <strong>compute
instances</strong> differs from platform to platform. Therefore, in
order to experiment with remote execution of workflows and be able to
pilot the whole range of SciWIn functionality, we have settled on
<strong>Reana</strong> (<span class="citation"
data-cites="simko2019">@simko2019</span>) as primary execution platform.
Originating from CERN, Reana is widely used and under active since 8
years. Our main reason to settle on Reana however was the fact that
NFDI4PUNCH provided us simple access to an instance at the
Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam through an informal
collaboaration. Furthermore, the BASE4NFDI project MC4NFDI (​__A
Multicloud Infrastructure for the NFDI_) would have ensured robust,
well-integrated access to Reana clusters for users of SciWIn.
Unfortunately, the MC4NFDI proposal was rejected in the 7th submission
round.</p>
<p>we could initially get simple access to an instance with NFDI4PUNCH.
MC4NFDI (​A Multicloud Infrastructure for the NFDI) workflowhub.eu

<p>settled on the workflow description language CWL (<span
class="citation" data-cites="crusoe2022">@crusoe2022</span>), on -
Compute instances: in principle general CWL capable, in practice reana,
in principle any Reana in practice our own - Workflow objects : Move
from ARC as central data structure to multi-data container

<p>Develop the concept of SciWIn (Measure 4.4) jointly together under
the umbrella of the NFDI-RDC and collaborate with NFDI4BioDiversity and
DataPLANT as well as the prototypic container deployment to the de.NBI
cloud node at BLU;</p>
<p>A SciWIn pilot will be rolled out at de.NBI operated by Bielefeld
University (BLU).</p>
<p>The concept of data integration is partly described in the RDC
mediation layer and covered by semantic tools (Glöckner et al., 2020),
and a concept for integrated data and process storage is part of the
DataPLANTs ARC model (Krantz et al., 2021), but a fully integrated
infrastructure is provided by neither of those consortia. Therefore,
Measure 4.4 will extend the two architectural designs and provide a
workflow infrastructure that applies the FAIR DO concepts (Measure 3.5),
the service middleware components (Measure 4.2) and its own workflow hub
as an easy-to-use interface to work on and create new FAIR DO outputs
with automatically annotated provenance graphs.</p>
<p>SciWIn will be part of the NFDI cross-cutting topic “RDC
implementations”, and therefore, its concept will be developed as a
joint effort between FAIRagro, FAIR-DS, Dataplant and the NFDI section,
RDC [as part of cross-cutting topics (Ebert et al., 2021)]. Coordinated
in Measure 5.3, the SciWIn working group brings these stakeholders
together and will be initiated by a kickoff meeting (M4.4.1). Thus, the
fundamental principles, architectures and interfaces are described, and
a coordinated concept will be created and published (D4.4.1), which will
incorporate the RDC ideas and DataPLANTs ARC model.</p>
